# Welcome to LeafEngine.
## What is Leaf engine?
**LeafEngine** first came out of a prototype, I was making to learn **OpenGL**.
So there is actully like 3 more version of this Engine but we are not gonna talk about them.
## How to Start
### Clone
Start by clonning the main branch some where on your computer.
### Build Solution
To build the solution you can directly launch the **vcpkgInstall.bat**
> You can check the command if you don't trust me. But I guarante you that it will just install vcpkg and all the required **Third Party**.
### Run
Now you can **run** the code.
## Third Party
- **GLFW**
- **OpenGL** *(including : glad)*
- **Vulkan** *(soon)*
- **Entt**
- **GLM**
