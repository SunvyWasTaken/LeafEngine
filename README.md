# Welcome to MiniMotor.
## What is MiniMotor?
- **MiniMotor** first came out of a prototype, I was making to learn **OpenGL**.
  > So there is actully like 3 more version of this Engine but we are not gonna talk about them.
- I want to keep learning and progress so **MiniMotor** is my sendbox to test things out.
  > I'm unemployed so this project keep me busy. And will be my Showcase.
## How to Start
### Clone
Start by clonning the main branch some where on your computer.
### Build Solution
To build the solution you can directly launch the **vcpkgInstall.bat**
> You can check the command if you don't trust me. But I guarante you that it will just install vcpkg and all the required **Third Party**.
### Run
Now you can **Build/Run** the code.
### Movement
You can move with your typical **WASD**, look around with the **mouse** and close the window with **Espace**
## Third Party
- **GLFW**
- **OpenGL** *(including : glad)*
- **Vulkan** *(soon)*
- **Entt**
- **GLM**
> I wanted to add **ImGui** but I run into a issues with the definition of the function to **Init ImGui with OpenGL** wasn't define which is weird cause I was downloading the last version of **ImGui** with the correct features with vcpkg. So, I set it aside.
> I also wanted to add **Assimp** but couldn't for the same reason of **ImGui**.
